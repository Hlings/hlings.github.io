    "extended_description": "The cabinet is a sophisticated piece of furniture designed for storing items in an organized manner. It features a rectangular cuboid frame with five individual drawers stacked vertically. These drawers slide in and out on rails for easy access and storage. Each drawer is accompanied by a handle at its front. The cabinet boasts a sleek and modern design, with clean lines and possibly different color finishes or wood grains. It stands on a set of four legs, slightly elevating it from the ground. Such a cabinet can be used in various settings — from offices to bedrooms — to store documents, accessories, clothes, or tools."
